# Entity Extraction Configuration
# ================================
# Optimized for speed and precision - fewer types with clear descriptions.
# GLiNER2 supports entity descriptions to reduce false positives.
#
# Each domain can have:
#   - enabled: true/false - whether to run entity extraction for this domain
#   - description: Used for domain classification (always active)
#   - entity_types: Types to extract (only if enabled)
#   - relation_types: Relations to extract (only if enabled)
#
# Domains with enabled=false are still detected during classification,
# allowing files to be SKIPPED from entity extraction entirely.
#
# IMPORTANT: For code/documentation files, the TypeScript parser already extracts
# functions, classes, methods as Scope nodes. GLiNER should NOT duplicate this.

# Entity types that should NOT have embeddings generated
# These are numeric/value types where embedding similarity doesn't make sense
skip_embedding_types:
  - price
  - date
  - quantity
  - amount
  - currency
  - size
  - duration

# Default settings (used when no domain is detected)
# Focused on universal named entities
defaults:
  entity_types:
    person: "A human individual mentioned by their full name"
    organization: "A company, institution, government body, or named group"
    location: "A geographical place, city, country, or physical address"
    technology: "A named software, framework, programming language, or tool"
    product: "A commercial product or service with a specific name"
    date: "A specific date, time period, or deadline"
  relation_types:
    works_for: "person works for organization"
    located_in: "entity is located in location"
    created_by: "product/technology created by person/organization"
    uses: "organization/person uses technology"

# Domain-specific presets
domains:
  # CODE domain - DISABLED: TypeScript parser already extracts code entities as Scope nodes
  code:
    enabled: false
    description: "Text about programming, software, functions, APIs, source code"
    # No entity_types needed - detection only, extraction skipped

  # DOCUMENTATION domain - DISABLED: Too noisy for technical docs
  documentation:
    enabled: false
    description: "Technical documentation, specifications, API docs, user guides"
    # No entity_types needed - detection only, extraction skipped

  # ECOMMERCE domain - ENABLED: Extract products, brands, ingredients
  ecommerce:
    enabled: true
    description: "Text about products, shopping, prices, brands, beauty, cosmetics"
