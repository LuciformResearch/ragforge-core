# Entity Extraction Configuration
# ================================
# This file configures domain presets for automatic entity extraction.
# Each domain defines:
#   - description: Used for multi-label classification
#   - entity_types: Types of entities to extract in this domain
#   - relation_types: Relations between entities (key: description)
#
# You can add custom domains or modify existing ones without changing code.

# Default settings (used when no domain is detected or specified)
